Do you really want to just install apk on device? +
Or you are actually developer and want to start it and see results like.. right now? +
Fear no more. Present magic piece of code, that can save you about 37 sec per month.


#### wtf?
Gradle plugin that add tasks to android projects for installing and launching installed app. +
Creates as many tasks as build variants your project have. +

Instead of copy-pasting from project to project task +
[source,groovy]
----
task runDebug1(type: Exec, dependsOn: 'installDebug') {
    def adb = android.getAdbExe().toString()
    commandLine "$adb", 'shell', 'am', 'start', '-n', 'som.awesome.app/.ui.MainActivity'
}
----

now it's enough to just apply this plugin.


#### how to apply

[source,groovy]
----
apply plugin: 'android-run-app'

repositories {
   jcenter()
}

buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "ae.vigilancer.gradle.plugin:android-run:1.0.1"
    }
}
----

#### how to use

Run `./gradlew tasks` and find `Running tasks` group. +
You'll see something like this:

[source]
----
Running tasks
....
runArmFreeappDebug - Install and run DebugArmFreeapp build.
runArmFreeappSomethingBlue - Install and run SomethingBlueArmFreeapp build.
runArmPaidappDebug - Install and run DebugArmPaidapp build.
runArmPaidappSomethingBlue - Install and run SomethingBlueArmPaidapp build.
----

*In example above there are no tasks for Release variants since test project have no signingConfig for Release.
